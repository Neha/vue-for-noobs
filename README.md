# vue-for-noobs
Welcome to Learning VueJS. This repo is my journal of learning VueJS. 

# How I am learning?
I believe in learning by doing. I think or get the ideas of a module, or a task or anything and I tried to
develop that in VueJS.

- I am following the book: [Vue.js: Up and Running ](https://www.flipkart.com/vue-js-up-running/)
- I am also following [Master Frontend's Sarah course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vue/)
- I am following random VueJS online videos 

As well as, I take help of community to review my code, approaches. Hence, big shout out to them.
